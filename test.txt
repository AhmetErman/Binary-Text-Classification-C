-1 \"He's hot.\" \n Oh my gosh, hahahahaha. \n 2 stars cause \"it was ok' \n This book was a fast read and it wasn't really that interesting.
-1 The book is more of a challenge than I have time for right now. It has come due at the library and I cannot renew it. I'll try again later.
-1 3.5 Stars! \n Parallel universes? Yes, please! I have always been intrigued with stories about the path not taken. The blurb of MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE intrigued me and made me think of one of my favorite movies, Sliding Doors. While this book was not all that I had hoped for, it is nonetheless a well-written, thought-provoking story about the consequences of our actions, fate and destiny. \n Taylor Jenkins Reid brings a unique and fresh voice to the idea that our soul mates are out there, and that our choices lead us to our own realities. Both parallel stories in this book were engaging, REAL, and very original. The characters are all very relatable and some of their stories more poignant than others. \n \"I know there may be universes out there where I made different choices and they led me somewhere else, led me to someone else. And my heart breaks for every single version of me that didn't end up with you.\" \n Our heroine Hannah takes two widely divergent paths, as does her best friend Gabby. I did feel an overriding sense of sadness while reading this book, which, happily, was replaced by joy by the end. MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE is a very thoughtful and interesting book, which will make you think about your choices in life, and whether fate ever really plays a part in our lives. Is everything all mapped out, occurring anyway no matter what our choices might be? There's lots to chew on here and I will say that I was totally surprised by the ending of this book. \n I would have like a little more detail about some of the more meaningful events in this book. However, much of this story seems aimed at twenty-somethings who will very much enjoy Hannah's journey. I did feel that some important details were missing, but overall, both the writing and the story were very intriguing and fresh. \n I read this in one sitting and I will definitely grab the author's other books now. Love, loss, family, friendship, loyalty -- they are all covered here and I think this is the perfect summertime read.", "date_added": "Tue Apr 14 20:44:55 -0700 2015
1 4.5 Kinky Stars!! \n Eve Dangerfield continues to delight with this verrrrrrry kinky and totally filthy story! But she also manages to be funny, heartfelt and utterly original. Highly recommend! \n \"Everyone is weird, Kate, we're the perfect kind of weird for each other.\" \n Yes, this book is about Daddy kink and it is oh so perfect! Eve Dangerfield writes smart, funny, nuanced characters which is what makes this story so readable. Kate is a young professional who has hidden her sexual fantasies away in shame. The focus of her current obsession is her boss, Ty, a 45 year old gruff, sexy former firefighter who pushes all her buttons. \n \"Her obsession wasn't even original. Everyone had a crush on Tyler Henderson. Women, gay men, straight men, more perceptive animals. It was like having a crush on a Hemsworth brother--it made you basic as hell. \n But she thinks Ty can't stand her because he can barely stand to be in the same room as her. He never speaks to her, calls her by her work nickname, and is generally just an all-around grouch. But...but...she's actually perfect for him! Because you see, Ty has always craved D/lg kink but has also hidden it away in shame, settling for unsatisfying relationships that make him feel empty and wanting more. \n \"Ty didn't think Middleton was a great girl. He thought Middleton was a pain in the ass. Waltzing around with her shiny hair and long legs and her throaty voice, being cuter than a fistful of buttons. Where did she get off? \n This book is filled with SO much hotness and hilarity and dirty talk that I couldn't believe what I was reading! But the story is SO engaging that I fell in love with Ty from the very first page. And the letter he writes to Kate!! OMG. *Faints* \n Ty and Kate are so perfect together but only Kate is brave enough to be honest with Ty and her feelings. I LOVED how she accepted what she wanted and who she was and never wavered. Ty was another story. He denied his true desires and felt shame for what he wanted. \n \"Wanting to fuck his pretty employee was biology, wanting to cherish her was something else. Something much worse. \n This book is refreshingly funny which balances out the incredibly steamy and passionate scenes. Eve Dangerfield is fearless! And I loved how Kate was far from perfect BUT she was perfect for Ty just the way she was. \n Ty glared at her. \"Think you're funny, don't you, Middleton?\" \n \"Yes.\" \n \"Well we'll see how fucking funny you are when your ass is on fire.\" \n This book is set in Australia so it is filled with slang and I did have to look up a few phrases here and there. Please read the book description and if does not sound like your cup of tea, then do not read this one. BUT if you are enamored with D/lg kink, as I am, then by all means read 'Act Your Age'! It is pure, growly Alpha-male goodness through and through. I can't wait to see what Eve Dangerfield dreams up next! \n What he and Middleton shared had gravity, it would pull her back toward him as surely as the moon pulled at the ocean tides. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
1 \"He was so addictive. Like candy. Or drugs. One taste of him had me fiending and my heart beating out of my chest.\" \n OH YES!!! I loved this fun and spicy slow-burn sports romance!! 'Illegal Contact' has the perfect mix of romance and heat. Any sports-romance lover will adore this story!! \n Football superstar Gavin Brawley of the New York Barons has major anger issues. A tough guy who grew up in the foster system, he is caught on video assaulting a man and as a result, is put on six months of house arrest. What is was really doing was protecting his friend but Gavin will take his punishment even though it means he is suspending from playing football, the only thing that saved him from a life of total despair. \n Most fans think Gavin is a total asshole. And he does little to nothing to dispel the public's opinion of him. In reality, he is a deeply closeted bisexual who has just a few close friends in his inner circle. He trusts no one outside his tight-knit circle. But because Gavin is a prisoner in his own home (a stunning mansion in the Hamptons), he is forced by his long-time manager to hire a PA to shop for him, cook his meals and run his errands. But Gavin is dead-set against this idea because he really doesn't like most people and he just wants to be left alone. \n \"I was a multimillionaire and a famous athlete, and yet people still treated me like a dirt-poor street kid from Newark. Some things never changed.\" \n Noah Monroe is in desperate need of a job. His last one ended badly and his father was just laid off. His student loans are looming over his head. He knows absolutely zero about football but that adds to his charm. And so he has no idea who Gavin Brawley is either. He is completely clueless but must find a job as soon as possible. He is out of options and will take any job, even if it is way outside his chosen field of social work. \n \"Was that the celebrity I'd be servicing? Bad choice of words. Was that the celebrity I'd be . . . personally assisting? I wasn't too clear on what this job would even entail. I'd just been told to send my resume and cover letter to Joe's receptionist.\" \n Of course Noah and Gavin cannot stand each other at first! Gavin is a total jerk to Noah. \n \"The man I hired has worked for movie stars, Gavin. He understands discretion.\" \n \"I don't give a shit if he understands quantum physics. He's more likely to land on the moon than set foot in this ridiculous mansion.\" \n I adore an enemies-to-lovers story. Gavin and Noah could not be more different. Gavin tries to shut Noah out of his life but he has to admit, Noah begins to do an amazing job as his PA. Noah begins to answer the huge amount of fan mail that has been accumulating and starts a social media presence for Gavin. So the fans actually begin to like Gavin Brawley. Gavin is wildly attracted to Noah but as a closeted bisexual, he feels that coming out would ruin his football career. Santino Hassell does a fantastic job of building their relationship from intense dislike, to friendship, to sweet, sweet romance. I could not put this story down! The sex scenes are CRAZY hot. Even when Noah and Gavin were breaking my heart, I just knew these two had to have a HEA. And boy, did they ever. \n I finished with my hands in his hair and our lips crushed together. It was an orgasm worthy of Olympic medals, but what really stopped my heart was the sound of my name in his lust-soaked voice. We were both in trouble. \n When Gavin finally begins to trust Noah, it is a beautiful thing. The banter, the sexy flirting, the touches of humor - it all worked for me. There is a second book planned in this series for Gavin's friend and teammate Simeon and let me just say that it sounds all kinds of awesome. I already miss these guys!! \n Gavin cocked a brow. \"If you think I'm going to try to spare your delicate baby eyes, I suggest you readjust your expectations. FYI--after showering, I air dry.\"
1 Just re-read this for the first time, and it's still one of my favorites. This book is geek-heaven: cryptography, world war II, code-breaking, nazi gold, and modern day internet beginnings all tied together in one masterful story. \n It also was largely lost on me, and I suspect many of my generation, that the second world war was won - or at least greatly accelerated - in great part due to the fact that we had cracked the German and Japanese codes. Learning more about the efforts of Bletchley Park, and Dr Alan Turing and huffduff and cribs, etc was fascinating. \n I think the funniest part of the book is the page where Stephenson actually graphs out how productive Waterhouse is when he has recently had sex (very productive) and when he hasn't (not very productive). \n The code-breaking and cryptography is not stuff I know a ton about, as modern day programmers largely don't have to worry about that stuff, but it's a good reminder to think about, as we don't have it on our brains nearly enough. Avi & Randy's paranoia and tendency to encrypt everything from their hard drives to their emails may be overkill, on the other hand, it also may be wise. I remember getting email from people who used public/private keys to encrypt their email before, but not in the last 5 years. Maybe we should request that Gmail Labs add that! \n If there was a theme to this book, it's that cryptography is everything. It defined the second world war, and it also defines the modern internet. Information is king - not large caches of gold.
1 A really interesting novel that takes place in the future in a world where some people live in the metaverse (aka digital universe/internet) more than the real world. I don't remember it so well now but I do remember there being some really interesting tie-ins to ancient sumarian computers. \n That plus any book with a protagonist named Hiro Protagonist who wields badass japanese swords is just badass. \n Note: the MetaVerse is current being built now here: http://secondlife.com
1 \"Now I know how much there is to be afraid of and it terrifies me. But at the same time, I feel like if I could live through that, what happened to us, then I can survive anything. Like, what is there really to be afraid of?\" \n This book has SO much going for it! A Bittersweet, friends-to-lovers story; a feisty and relatable heroine; AND a bad-boy hero. Kylie Scott is one of my favorite authors and 'Lick' remains one of my top favorite contemporary romance books. For those reasons, I stuck with this story and I'm so glad that I did. Edie is VERY different from most fictional heroines and for that, I applaud Ms. Scott. For once, the ordinary girl gets the guy! \n \"Kissing John was everything. Well, not everything everything. I wouldn't die without him. But all of me wanted him, my heart and my head and all of the rest. Without a doubt, he made life better.\" \n John and Edie experienced a life-changing trauma and it pretty much bonds them together. No one else can understand what they went through that fateful night at the convenience story and they have a tough time relating to their teachers, families and friends. They end up attending the same high school and I loved what the author had to say about bullying, fat-shaming and teenage angst. There are some light-hearted moments in this story as well and if Ms. Scott writes more YA novels, I will be first in line! With that said, there were some minor inconsistencies that took me out of the story a bit (there seemed to be some Aussie-speak thrown in - no American teenager uses some of the language that the author used) but all in all this was a sweet, funny and sexy romance that kept me turning the pages until the very end. \n \"You're here?\" \n \"Yeah.\" \n \"Why?\" \n \"Because this is where you are,\" he said, as if it were obvious. \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)
-1 This book should have been a nonfiction book presenting the silk factories. The plot and characters seemed to exist only to illustrate an aspect of Chinese history or factory conditions or options in 1920-30s China for women. \n I am intrigued by the hair dressing ceremony wherein women could choose to become a member of the sisterhood of silk workers, an alternative to arranged marriages. A parallel ceremony to marriage; the choice as permanent. Like secular nuns. \n Even if the factories allowed women to escape family and marriage, even if it allowed them to send some support home, it is not a good excuse for running a sweatshop, and this factory did become/was always that--hence the strike. However, the strike was unconvincing; the results too easy. I have read about the labor movement's beginning in the US of A, and I must confess that I am now interested to learn to what extent there was a parallel movement in China, and if indeed it was that much easier than in the US. \n There seemed an abrupt shift from isolated rural to involvement with the Japanese invasion. While it was abrupt, it may have reflected the awareness of the rural people as the fighting moved closer to them. So I have mixed feelings about the ending. There were slight hints earlier of trouble up north. The entrance of difficulties still felt sudden and intrusive. Maybe war is like that.
1 Really good book. It read like a bestseller (quick read), but had a lot of substance to stop and make you think. \n three Rules of the tipping point: the law of the few, the stickyness factor, the power of context. \n Law of the Few (people who influence): \n - Connectors: super connectors (eg Paul Revere). William Dawes had the same mission as Paul Revere the same night but we haven't heard of him b/c Paul Revere was a super-connector & knew who to rouse. \n - Mavens: A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace. \n - Salesmen: people with the skills of persuasion. Good at reading people entering into \"conversational harmony\" with them. Facial gestures (nods, smiles, frowns) are key indicators. Emotional Mimicry. Studies showed Peter Jennings viewers voted Republican b/c he unconsciously smiled more while covering Reagan. \n Stickyness Factor \n - Sesame street succeeded b/c it learned to make TV sticky. It did a TON of testing with focus groups of kids to increase stickyness (how much kids remembered) of each show. They would cut scenes that didn't hold attention until each show \n was good. \n - Blues Clues did even more testing and discovered that kids love repetition - it plays the same show 5 times in a row and kids love it. \n - make the message personal to make it memorable \n The Power of Context \n - Broken window theory. NYC cleaned up its crime epidemic by cleaning off the graffiti from its subways. \n - Often to change human behavior you have to change the context the problem is presented in. \n - Stanford Prison Experiment by Zimbardo proved that context matters. \n - law of 150: a person can't 'know' more than 150 people, so companies usually start to fail at that point. Gore-Tex breaks up a company into 2 once it hits 150, because they've found things work better that way.
1 4.5 \"Big Red\" Stars!! \n OMG this is one of THE funniest and absolutely dirtiest books I've ever read! Eve Dangerfield has a fresh and VERY unique voice and I adored this story. \n \"You're stunning,\" he said, eyeing her up and down. His irises weren't watery blue like most redheads, but a warm caramel brown. Ash's lady areas tingled, as though they too craved a cigarette. \n \"Thanks.\" \n Can I keep this review clean? Hard to do, based on how naughty this book is. Ashley is a hard-working nurse who has THE worst taste in men and decides she is finished with boyfriends. What she wants is a baby and a good sperm donor. A former model, Ash was a party girl but has always been sensitive about her lower-class background and loser parents. Raised by her grandmother, she and her sister Julia are best friends and share everything. \n Julia's boyfriend Max has a gorgeous red-headed roommate named Dean. A big lovable bear of a man, Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash, that's IT for him. And Ash feels the same. A ginger? No way! \n He wasn't a pretty boy, his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided, but he had that square-jawed, salt-of-the-earth handsome look that made a girl think of loose-hipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds. And speaking of Scottish Lairds, old mate was a redhead. Usually gingers weren't her scene but this guy's hair was the rich coppery-auburn of a fox's pelt. It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights, his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head. Big Red was doing it for her. Big time. And apparently, the feeling was mutual.\" \n Dean is one of the most original MC's I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Sensitive, kind, loving, he wears his heart on his sleeve. Trouble is, he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought. Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her! What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read. \n \"You women, always trying to rush straight to sex. Whatever happened to romance?\" \n Dean and Ash were perfect together. There's tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story. Between the 'Princess Bride' references, the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes, this book was a win for me. The dialogue crackles and the characters are all well-written and so REAL. I can't put my finger on what makes a book work for me, but 'Open Hearts' has \"it.\" I couldn't book this book down! Filled with heat, heart and humor, 'Open Hearts' is one of my favorite books this year. \n Favorite quotes: \n \"He had to be six-four or five, lean, but beefy everywhere it counted. How would all that weight feel bearing down on her? She imagined his handsome face screwed up in pleasure as he pounded away at her practically revirginized p---y. Everything below her belly button tightened.\" \n \"They'd tried to diagnose him but there was no apparent medical explanation for his behaviour. He was just what his mum called 'away with the fairies' and Max called 'a bit of a lost \n c--t.'\" \n \"You're my dream girl, Ash. No one even comes close.\"
-1 A great finish to the D'Artagnan series - definitely enjoyed it. Ending wasn't what I wanted though, you could tell he was just trying to permanently end the series. It could easily be having seen the movie made me want more drama.

-1 Writing is all over the place. My first Megan Hart book. No clear point of view.
1 Great book about Galileo from the perspective of his daughter.
1 I haven't stayed up until 5am to finish a book in a while - it felt good. This was a great murder-mystery thriller, and more interesting as it's set in Sweden and deals with journalists, corporations, and hackers. Good stuff!
1 Smart and sexy and delicious! I devoured this one. LOVE Ryder!!!! \n This is my second 1001 Dark nights novella and I really like this concept. Many of my favorite authors have written a novella in this format and so far, I have enjoyed the stories. Although 'Sweet Rivalry' is a standalone, Ryder first appeared in 'Sweet Cheeks' as Saylor's brother. This novella is a steamy, sweet and fast-paced romance that you can devour in one sitting. This short story is perfect for fans of Kristy Bromberg's steamy yet witty writing style. \n Ryder and his competitor Harper are bidding on a major construction project. They first met up during their college days and she has always been the best at everything. But Ryder is determined to win this time. Of course, they have some major chemistry, but business is business, right? \n \"Beard burn is a real thing. \n And oh my God it is everything I wanted it to be and then some. \" \n I always love the strong heroines in Kristy Bromberg's books. That is one of my favorites things about her writing. No wallflowers here! If you are looking for a fast, sexy, witty read with a guaranteed happy ending, then 'Sweet Rivalry' is just the ticket. My one complaint? That this story wasn't longer! Maybe we will get a full-length book about these two someday! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
1 I really enjoyed this book. The concept of a man who had grown up on Mars and never seen another human until he was in his twenties is such a fun idea - and a rich canvas. Watching Mike try to grok humans gave a Heinlein great opportunities to point out some of our faults - and our advantages. \n I think my favorite part of this book is the word 'grok'. I would bet that there are deep discussions over the true meaning of this word - but I will contend that its closest meaning in English is 'to be enlightened about something'. If you grok God you have reached enlightenment. If you grok music you truly understand in the way that Mozart understood it. If you grok another person you love them. If you grok programming then you truly love and are really good at programming - that, and you're also a probably a pretty big nerd for using a word like 'grok' :) I used it in front of my girlfriend and she still hasn't forgiven me, since I had to explain that it was \"a Martian word\"! \n One thing that I grokked (yes I'm going to keep using it dammit) after finishing this book is that it is kind of a 60's manifesto for free love. I wasn't alive in the 60's, but given everything I know about the 60's from movies, books, etc it seemed that my grokking was right.
-1 The book held my interest. The pacing between present and past added interest even if it did occasionally get difficult to follow. \n The characters were likable and mostly believable. Not sure about Atticus. (view spoiler)[ Were we to see his interest in the council as the abstract earlier interest in the Klan, only to see who else was involved or maybe to temper it, or was it a total sellout as Jean Louise sees it. Is his praise of her finally being able to make a judgement different than his believable? Not quite. (hide spoiler)] \n Worth having read.
-1 After a sample of three, I see a pattern: lone character in a strange setting, establish the setting for a couple chapters, then gradually introduce other characters and fill in the past that got them to the strange state. I enjoyed references to the first volume. \n This second book had more slow moments than the first of the series, but when it was good it was very good. I am not yet sure what to make of the God's Garden religion. Sometimes it seemed excessive, other times wise.
-1 Please please please don't let there be typos in the finished book like there are in the Goodreads summary!!
1 I read a bunch of Bond books in High School and hadn't read one since, so I really enjoyed this one. As I remember a few of them being, it was very different from the movie. Though the main players - Scaramanga, Goodnight, and Felix Leiter - were all still there - but there was no midget! Bond books are simple, yet somehow still very compelling. The way Flemming wrote, Bond seems much more human and susceptible, yet determined and focused him - in the movies he seems more superhuman. I think Daniel Craig's movies are actually bringing that aspect of bond back a little bit. \n In any event I greatly enjoyed the duel between Scaramanga and Bond.
-1 I want the book now \n March 18, 2013: The cover is gorg!!
1 I loved this book. I agree with Elizabeth - the movie wasn't close. Something about Nicholas Cage trying to do an italian accent?
1 One of my all-time favorites. The ultimate revenge story. One fascinating aspect to think about was that back in the day this novel appeared as a series of articles in the newspaper in France...
1 I read this after hearing from a few people that it was among their all-time favorites. I was almost put off when I saw it was a story about rabbits, originally written as a tale by a father to his children - but I'm glad I wasn't. \n I found the folk tales about El-ahrairah to be very impressive. The author clearly had a vivid imagination to create so much of the rabbits culture and history. But I think this book was worth reading as it's really a story about survival, leadership, and human nature. \n Oh and Fiver rocks. And BigWig is the man.
1 After seeing the movie (i liked it), and needing a fun read for a vacation, this was perfect. Like Jacques, I loved the explanation of Baccarat. My mental image of Vesper Lynd in the book is much prettier than the actress from the movie. Fleming's Bond is much more of a connoisseur than the movie Bond, and he takes great care in describing all the details of the things he enjoys - particularly his cigarettes, his food, his wine, and his car.
-1 1.5 stars? If I were to describe this book in one word I'd say \"disappointed.\" I feel like I should give this book 1 stars because I didn't really enjoy it, on the other hand, it's not \"bad,\" per say. The plot twist that everyone is raving about didn't even surprise me. I had already deduced something similar several chapters back. Oh well.
-1 A friend of Elizabeth's I met at a party said its a great primer to understanding philosophy...
-1 Maybe it was just not a good time, but I couldn't get through it... I loved Of Mice And Men though.
-1 Surreal. Entertaining. Far more allusions than I can recognize. Worth pondering.
1 I'm not sure if I love Khaled's characters (see my review of The Kite Runner), but the man can tell a story. I think all Americans need to read this book, as it helps to understand and sympathize with what the people in Afghanistan have gone through. Particularly interesting as the book spans 30+ years and paints a very graphic picture of how Afghanistan changed in that time. From Russian communists to warlords to the Taliban to US Army, there have been no shortage of invaders and wars, and victims. Khaled leaves out little of the misery and death, but also focuses on how life invariably always finds a way. \n So a little sad, but I liked it. I think the thing I liked most was that I've read so few books about that area of the world, and now I feel like I've gotten to know it, just a tiny bit.
-1 DNF. I got about half way before I lost interest in this book. \n I really enjoyed the writing, and the beginning was most enjoyable imo. This had some pretty outrageous moments but I believe that's part of its charm. Maybe one day I'll pick it back up and finish it but I am way too behind in my reading challenge to try and force myself to finish a book I'm not interested in anymore.
1 Listened it on tape on a road trip... thoroughly enjoyed it!
-1 Many readers loved this book but it just wasn't for me. I am a fan of dark romance, dark erotica, romantic thrillers, the whole nine yards so the darker elements were fine for me but I just didn't connect with the main characters. I definitely suggest giving this book a try because the story has a lot of promise but there were just too many character and plot inconsistencies for me to become invested in the story. I will read the author's other books because they sound very interesting and readers whose opinion I trust have really loved her writing.
1 \"You smile like the devil,\" Mona said. \n \"The devil doesn't smile,\" he said. \"The devil smirks.\" \n STUNNING!! Ms. Reisz proves once again she is the Queen of erotica. The story and characters are all richly drawn and unforgettable. Mona Lisa St. James made a promise to her mother that she would do anything at all to save their art gallery. But the gallery is in financial trouble and she must sell it. And soon. \n But then a handsome Englishman arrives and makes her an irresistible offer. He will save her gallery. But she must agree to be his for one year. \n \"You were meant to do this,\" he said softly. \"You'll see.\" \n \"Why me?\" she asked. \"Millions of women in this country, millions in yours...why me?\" \n \"Millions of paintings in this world. Only one Mona Lisa. Billions of women in this world. Only one you, Mona Lisa St. James.\" \n And so begins the most erotic and sensual adventures Mona has ever had. A sexual awakening of sorts, Mona and the mysterious Malcolm shares his most erotic and depraved fantasies. Yet each and every encounter is sexy and beautiful and simply stunning!! Malcolm is judgement-free and slowly begins to understand her true nature and what life has in store for her. \n I can't even begin to describe how incredibly sensual and hot the scenes between Mona and Malcolm are. Each of their encounters is a wild and delightful fantasy, interwoven with mythology, history and lush eroticism. \n \"Is this all a dream?\" That's the only thing that makes any sense. \n \"You aren't dreaming,\" he said, and she knew that was true. She was awake and had been every time they had met. \"But if you were a dream, would you want to wake up?\" he asked. \n A good question. A fair question. A hard question, but one she answered easily. \n \"Never.\" \n I absolutely loved the conclusion to this gorgeous story. It was surprising and thrilling and completely satisfying! I fell in love with the rakish Malcolm. This book is unlike anything I've ever read. Tiffany Reisz writes with sensuality and skill. 'The Red' is a must-read for all erotic romance lovers!! \n \"Do anything you must, but keep me forever.\" \n (With many thanks to the author for a review copy.)
-1 Markus Zusak made a post about how he enjoyed this book...must check it out now!
-1 ***3.5 Stars*** \n Ok so under normal circumstances Nick would be all kinds of creepy for watching Daisy. But looking at it as a fictional perspective.... It's still odd but once you read on and get to know Nick you understand that in a way he doesn't know any better. \n \"I was born a killer, my teeth bared, and I claimed my first victim almost before I had taken my first breath. But that is Ukraine. A boy on the streets without a gun is prey. I have never been prey. Always the hunter.\" \n \"It takes many muscles to smile, more to frown, but only few to pull the trigger.\" \n Of course being the main characters and all you can't help but fall in love with Nick and Daisy. To watch both of them get over their fears and discover life together. \n \"There is something so vibrant, so aware, so alive about him that it sings to me. I am drawn to him like a moth to a flame.\" \n \" I will kiss you Daisy. I will kiss you all night. I will do more than kiss you if you wish.\" \n Daisy has just escaped her father's prison and Nikolai is attempting to free himself from the only life he knows, at the same time they are trying to build their first relationship. \n Neither one of them knows what to do, what's right and wrong in a relationship. But together they work on building their trust and love for one another even through the obstacles their old insecurities and fears throw their way. \n \" I knew I could not keep you,\" he says. His voice is hoarse with emotion. \"Such a beautiful, innocent soul. I just wanted you for as long as I could have you. I knew it was wrong, and I did not care. Someday I hope you forgive me.\" \n There were times I just wanted to shake some sense into Daisy, and there were times that I also wanted to tell Nikolai to Man up but I did enjoy learning about them. \n \" The villains had a hard life. They did not know any other way forward.\" \n \" I can't hate Nick.

-1 Stopped reading this at page 91. I don't know if it's just the mood I'm in or what, but I could not get into this at all. Disappointing.
1 A hilarious romp through the known and unknown universe that exposes how ridiculous much of US copyright law is. Written by the founder of Rhapsody, who knows a thing or two about music and the copyright surrounding it. What I didn't expect from a book by an entrepreneur is a funny book - and this book is not bad. It is being compared to Hitchhikers Guide, which nothing can approach, but its not bad. My only gripe would be there are a ton of footnotes that attempt to extend the humor and most of them didn't work for me. \n The basic premise of the book is brilliant; that aliens have been listening to - and thus pirating - our music since 1977, without our knowledge. Because US copyright law states that a single case of intentional copyright violation can be fined $150,000 - this means the entire universe is many times over in debt to humanity. \n It's pretty ridiculous that the music industry got such a big fine to be passed. I think one of my favorite parts of the book was learning about the law firm that Nick Carter works for, and seeing a little under the hood of how they operate. \n Overall a fun, enjoyable read.
