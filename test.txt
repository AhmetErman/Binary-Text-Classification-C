1 4.5 \"Big Red\" Stars!! \n OMG this is one of THE funniest and absolutely dirtiest books I've ever read! Eve Dangerfield has a fresh and VERY unique voice and I adored this story. \n \"You're stunning,\" he said, eyeing her up and down. His irises weren't watery blue like most redheads, but a warm caramel brown. Ash's lady areas tingled, as though they too craved a cigarette. \n \"Thanks.\" \n Can I keep this review clean? Hard to do, based on how naughty this book is. Ashley is a hard-working nurse who has THE worst taste in men and decides she is finished with boyfriends. What she wants is a baby and a good sperm donor. A former model, Ash was a party girl but has always been sensitive about her lower-class background and loser parents. Raised by her grandmother, she and her sister Julia are best friends and share everything. \n Julia's boyfriend Max has a gorgeous red-headed roommate named Dean. A big lovable bear of a man, Dean has coasted through life but when he meets Ash, that's IT for him. And Ash feels the same. A ginger? No way! \n He wasn't a pretty boy, his nose was crooked and his grin lopsided, but he had that square-jawed, salt-of-the-earth handsome look that made a girl think of loose-hipped cowboys and demanding Scottish Lairds. And speaking of Scottish Lairds, old mate was a redhead. Usually gingers weren't her scene but this guy's hair was the rich coppery-auburn of a fox's pelt. It gleamed like rose gold under the floodlights, his short beard the exact colour as the stuff on his head. Big Red was doing it for her. Big time. And apparently, the feeling was mutual.\" \n Dean is one of the most original MC's I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Sensitive, kind, loving, he wears his heart on his sleeve. Trouble is, he has a tiny little problem focusing and drifts off right in the middle of a thought. Ash wants to use him but he wants more from her! What a fun change of pace from the usual contemporary romance books I read. \n \"You women, always trying to rush straight to sex. Whatever happened to romance?\" \n Dean and Ash were perfect together. There's tons of Australian slang and references in this book but they did not distract from the story. Between the 'Princess Bride' references, the Tessa Bailey mention and the hilarious and STEAMY sex scenes, this book was a win for me. The dialogue crackles and the characters are all well-written and so REAL. I can't put my finger on what makes a book work for me, but 'Open Hearts' has \"it.\" I couldn't book this book down! Filled with heat, heart and humor, 'Open Hearts' is one of my favorite books this year. \n Favorite quotes: \n \"He had to be six-four or five, lean, but beefy everywhere it counted. How would all that weight feel bearing down on her? She imagined his handsome face screwed up in pleasure as he pounded away at her practically revirginized p---y. Everything below her belly button tightened.\" \n \"They'd tried to diagnose him but there was no apparent medical explanation for his behaviour. He was just what his mum called 'away with the fairies' and Max called 'a bit of a lost \n c--t.'\" \n \"You're my dream girl, Ash. No one even comes close.\"
1 \"He was so addictive. Like candy. Or drugs. One taste of him had me fiending and my heart beating out of my chest.\" \n OH YES!!! I loved this fun and spicy slow-burn sports romance!! 'Illegal Contact' has the perfect mix of romance and heat. Any sports-romance lover will adore this story!! \n Football superstar Gavin Brawley of the New York Barons has major anger issues. A tough guy who grew up in the foster system, he is caught on video assaulting a man and as a result, is put on six months of house arrest. What is was really doing was protecting his friend but Gavin will take his punishment even though it means he is suspending from playing football, the only thing that saved him from a life of total despair. \n Most fans think Gavin is a total asshole. And he does little to nothing to dispel the public's opinion of him. In reality, he is a deeply closeted bisexual who has just a few close friends in his inner circle. He trusts no one outside his tight-knit circle. But because Gavin is a prisoner in his own home (a stunning mansion in the Hamptons), he is forced by his long-time manager to hire a PA to shop for him, cook his meals and run his errands. But Gavin is dead-set against this idea because he really doesn't like most people and he just wants to be left alone. \n \"I was a multimillionaire and a famous athlete, and yet people still treated me like a dirt-poor street kid from Newark. Some things never changed.\" \n Noah Monroe is in desperate need of a job. His last one ended badly and his father was just laid off. His student loans are looming over his head. He knows absolutely zero about football but that adds to his charm. And so he has no idea who Gavin Brawley is either. He is completely clueless but must find a job as soon as possible. He is out of options and will take any job, even if it is way outside his chosen field of social work. \n \"Was that the celebrity I'd be servicing? Bad choice of words. Was that the celebrity I'd be . . . personally assisting? I wasn't too clear on what this job would even entail. I'd just been told to send my resume and cover letter to Joe's receptionist.\" \n Of course Noah and Gavin cannot stand each other at first! Gavin is a total jerk to Noah. \n \"The man I hired has worked for movie stars, Gavin. He understands discretion.\" \n \"I don't give a shit if he understands quantum physics. He's more likely to land on the moon than set foot in this ridiculous mansion.\" \n I adore an enemies-to-lovers story. Gavin and Noah could not be more different. Gavin tries to shut Noah out of his life but he has to admit, Noah begins to do an amazing job as his PA. Noah begins to answer the huge amount of fan mail that has been accumulating and starts a social media presence for Gavin. So the fans actually begin to like Gavin Brawley. Gavin is wildly attracted to Noah but as a closeted bisexual, he feels that coming out would ruin his football career. Santino Hassell does a fantastic job of building their relationship from intense dislike, to friendship, to sweet, sweet romance. I could not put this story down! The sex scenes are CRAZY hot. Even when Noah and Gavin were breaking my heart, I just knew these two had to have a HEA. And boy, did they ever. \n I finished with my hands in his hair and our lips crushed together. It was an orgasm worthy of Olympic medals, but what really stopped my heart was the sound of my name in his lust-soaked voice. We were both in trouble. \n When Gavin finally begins to trust Noah, it is a beautiful thing. The banter, the sexy flirting, the touches of humor - it all worked for me. There is a second book planned in this series for Gavin's friend and teammate Simeon and let me just say that it sounds all kinds of awesome. I already miss these guys!! \n Gavin cocked a brow. \"If you think I'm going to try to spare your delicate baby eyes, I suggest you readjust your expectations. FYI--after showering, I air dry.\"
-1 3.5 Stars \n I am one of Katy's biggest fans and read everything she writes! I always love her powerful heroes and Aaric Christos is one of her best Alphas! Strong, driven and brilliant, I loved everything about him. . \n \"It's never been a game with you.\" \n Bryn is in desperate need of funding for her start-up company. She has risen from her past tragedies and is determined to make her new business successful. But first she must convince Aaric to lend her the money to get her business off the ground. \n Aaric is now very much involved with a wealthy socialite girlfriend but Bryn and Aaric have a past and knew each other years before. I loved the second-chance romance aspect of this story! Along with the New Your City setting, this was a perfectly enjoyable contemporary romance with Katy Evans' trademark brand of HOT sexiness. Will Bryn be able to put aside her personal feelings so that she and Aaric can keep things strictly business? \n \"He's the biggest what if I've ever had in my life. The one you always wonder about.\" \n There's some drama here but it works in the story. I loved Aaric's point of view and feel that it really gave his character depth. He seemed so allofll of at first but then really became someone I was rooting for by the end. The sexy times are perfect and it all added up to a fast-paced and enjoyable contemporary romance. \n I would have loved to have learned more about Aaric and Bryn when they were younger; the flashback scenes left me wanting more! If you are a fan of Katy Evans and of second-chance romance, you will love this one! \n (ARC provided in return for an honest review.)
1 4.5 Stars \n Holy moly!!! What to say about this delicious, erotic, COMPLETELY taboo romance? Enter at your own risk!! Reading this book was like riding a roller coaster - my emotions were all over the place. Ms. Saffron Kent is an author to watch. And Professor Thomas Abrams? I honestly have no words. \n Some books have \"it\" - an undefinable quality that hooks the reader from the beginning and doesn't let go. 'The Unrequited' has \"it.\" Once I started reading this steamy forbidden romance, I simply could not put it down. \n \"Bravery is like falling in love. You donaEUR(tm)t know if the person will reciprocate, but still you fall. \" \n Heed the warnings in the synopsis, and if you are not a fan of forbidden romance or cheating, then move along. But there is SO much more to this book! Thomas and Layla's story is very nuanced and adult and very complicated. And so, so erotic!! \n \"The Harlot fell in love with the Fire-breather. It was beautiful and right. It was wrong and ugly, just like the earth beneath my feet. It was tragic and ecstatic. It was everything IaEUR(tm)d hoped love could be.\" \n Saffon Kent did a fantastic job creating two very different protagonists. Layla is passionate, self-deprecating, very open and brutally honest. She is a true original. Thomas is brilliant, sexy, introspective and sarcastic. Layla is heartbroken and possibly crazy after being rejected by her one true love. She is required to enroll in college and attend class as part of her therapy. She ends up in Professor Thomas Abrams' poetry class and immediately realizes she is in way over her head. He is rude to her and sees through her charade. \n But Thomas has secrets, too. Yes he is married but there is much, much more to his story than just that simple fact. Cold, aloof and arrogant, he is the complete opposite of Layla. You just know that Thomas and Layla will be a total train wreck together, but you just can't look away.
1 \"You smile like the devil,\" Mona said. \n \"The devil doesn't smile,\" he said. \"The devil smirks.\" \n STUNNING!! Ms. Reisz proves once again she is the Queen of erotica. The story and characters are all richly drawn and unforgettable. Mona Lisa St. James made a promise to her mother that she would do anything at all to save their art gallery. But the gallery is in financial trouble and she must sell it. And soon. \n But then a handsome Englishman arrives and makes her an irresistible offer. He will save her gallery. But she must agree to be his for one year. \n \"You were meant to do this,\" he said softly. \"You'll see.\" \n \"Why me?\" she asked. \"Millions of women in this country, millions in yours...why me?\" \n \"Millions of paintings in this world. Only one Mona Lisa. Billions of women in this world. Only one you, Mona Lisa St. James.\" \n And so begins the most erotic and sensual adventures Mona has ever had. A sexual awakening of sorts, Mona and the mysterious Malcolm shares his most erotic and depraved fantasies. Yet each and every encounter is sexy and beautiful and simply stunning!! Malcolm is judgement-free and slowly begins to understand her true nature and what life has in store for her. \n I can't even begin to describe how incredibly sensual and hot the scenes between Mona and Malcolm are. Each of their encounters is a wild and delightful fantasy, interwoven with mythology, history and lush eroticism. \n \"Is this all a dream?\" That's the only thing that makes any sense. \n \"You aren't dreaming,\" he said, and she knew that was true. She was awake and had been every time they had met. \"But if you were a dream, would you want to wake up?\" he asked. \n A good question. A fair question. A hard question, but one she answered easily. \n \"Never.\" \n I absolutely loved the conclusion to this gorgeous story. It was surprising and thrilling and completely satisfying! I fell in love with the rakish Malcolm. This book is unlike anything I've ever read. Tiffany Reisz writes with sensuality and skill. 'The Red' is a must-read for all erotic romance lovers!! \n \"Do anything you must, but keep me forever.\" \n (With many thanks to the author for a review copy.)
1 \"We got here, baby, through fire and blades, demons and curses, blood and plagues.\" \n Just WOW. I had high hopes for 'Fury' and Cat Porter exceeded every single one of my expectations and then some!! A gritty, incredibly sensual and emotional thrill ride. Put this one on your must-read list! \n \"Why did we have to sacrifice love for love?\" \n This is a story that spans decades and offers up the very best in the MC romance genre. There are many biker books out there but Cat Porter is one of the most talented writers in this genre. From the minute we first meet Lenore, she is tortured, anguished an abused. Finger is a young prospect being held prisoner and their bonds are forged in fire. \n Finger never forgets Lenore. She is branded onto his soul. There's is a love story that literally spans many years but cannot be denied. Once again, Ms. Porter writes characters that are devastatingly honest and real and their emotions are raw and brutal. The MC life is not an easy one. Many scenes in this book are raw and graphic. But through it all, Finger and Lenore rise above their savage pasts. \n \"Hell and heaven. Beautiful and horrible. We found each other first in the dark and then in the light and in all the shadows in between. No matter how I tried convincing myself that I should forget, the scars never allowed it.\" \n 'Fury' is a total roller-coaster ride of emotions. It takes a lot for me to cry but this book brought me to my knees! Never in a million years did I expect the twist to this book. AND, as if there wasn't enough to love about this story, I fell in love with Tania! HELLO. \n My favorite books involve couples who are older and have lived and experienced life. 'Fury' delivers that and then some. Finger and Lenore have suffered and triumphed through so much, I was hoping against hope that they would find their happy ending. Loyalty, brotherhood, love, devotion, revenge and friendship...'Fury' has it all. Don't miss this one!! \n \"She is at the crux. She is the flame. My fever, my fury. Let it roar.\"
1 4.5 Stars!! \n LOVED this sexy-sweet and romantic story!! I fell in love with the characters in this book and absolutely LOVE this author!! I knew from the first page that I would love this romance. Highly recommend. Full review to follow.
1 \"I'm curious whether you could ever like me, whether someone like you could be friends with someone like me.\" \n Sweet and lovely and important and fresh. Love the message of this book! \n Autoboyography is a beautifully written and very poignant M/M story with a MESSAGE. On the one hand is Tanner, a bisexual teen whose family accepts him and loves him for who he is, On the other hand is Sebastian, a devoted member of the Church of LDS whose rigid and intensely religious family strictly follows the doctrines of the church. Where homosexuality is forbidden. \n Tanner moved from California to Provo, Utah with his family when his mother accepted a wonderful job there. Although \"out\" to his family, he cannot be openly bisexual due to the overwhelmingly Mormon majority of his classmates, friends and the town. He falls hard for Sebastian, when he meets Seb in a writing class. Sebastian is about to have his first book published and is something of a celebrity around school and in town. He is also the teaching assistant for the writing class. The goal of the class is to write a book by the end of the course. \n \"Come on. I moved here when I was fifteen--which I think we can agree is the worst time to move from Palo Alto, California, to Provo, Utah--with a mouth full of metal and no friends. I have stories.\" Not to mention I'm a half-Jewish queer kid in a straight and Mormon town. \n Tanner becomes infatuated with Sebastian, but has no clue if his feelings are reciprocated. He is unsure if he is reading the signals wrong, or if Sebastian is just deeply closeted. Sebastian helps Tanner with his book. Could it be even remotely possible that Sebastian is gay? \n \"But how can I send my heart to him when he's just said, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn't speak its language?\" \n My heart ached for Sebastian and Tanner. Yes they did fall in love. And Sebastian's religion made him feel worthless and unloved by God and rejected by his family. He struggled with his feelings but knew that his family would never, ever accept his sexual orientation. So perfect from the outside, his family was actually intensely judgmental. \n I adored Tanner and the sweet romance that developed between these two. This is not a steamy romance at all but it was very passionate and sweet and believable and REAL. While the beliefs of the Mormon church sometimes felt like they were being recited from a textbook, I understood how Sebastian could be so torn between his service to the Church, and his desire to live an authentic life. How beautiful it was that he finally found someone to love. \n There are no evil characters here. Sebastian's parents simply see no other path for their son other than his upcoming missionary work for three years. That is what they did, and that is what is expected of Sebastian. This book is about having the courage to stand up for your principles and for who you are. When Sebastian finally realizes that, he has already broken Tanner's heart. This book is a journey that asks some tough and heartbreaking questions along the way. \n Seb and Tanner were hot for each other. It was a healthy exploration of their sexuality, but Seb's parents got to him and influenced him break up with Tanner. \n These are two sweet, loyal, kind and funny boys. They deserve happiness! I think it is hard for most people to accept a church that basically cuts parents off from their own children based on who they love. \n Overall I enjoyed the book because Tanner and Seb were so endearing and brave. I felt that the constant reminder that Tanner was a \"half-Jew in a Mormon town\" was overused, I got it the first 3 times it was mentioned . (Also not a fan of the new trend of placing a Nordstrom in virtually town in books. That takes me out of the book. If that part is fictional, what else about the LDS is made up? That's my dilemma.) \n Hopefully the LDS Church will have a \"revelation\" soon about coming out as gay or bi so that all of the wonderful young people can lead a full life with the love and acceptance of their families, friends and church. \n \"To think that God loves the trees, but condemns that blossoming thing they do in the spring.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)
1 First let me be clear that I ADORE Mia Asher and love her books. And this book was a perfectly sexy, fast-paced and truly engrossing story. And the cover...WOW!! One of my favorite covers ever and that is very important to me in deciding whether to read a book. \n The description is fabulous and the first half of the book was really fantastic. Just what I love in a contemporary romance. Valentina has been hurt by her husband William, and decides to stay in Paris alone when William cancels his travel plans there. Their trip was going to be an effort to reconnect as husband and wife, and re-kindle their love for each other. \n Valentina has become somewhat lost in her marriage, and feels that Paris will give her freedom and the opportunity to find her true self once again. She feels herself growing stronger as a person every day, and falls in love with the city. \n \"My arms outstretched, I'd danced to the vibrant music of life. I prayed for romance, adventure, the unknown. I wanted to fall in love and love to the point of no return. I wanted the turmoil, the stress, the upheaval, and chaos--the Sturm und Drang.\" \n And Sebastien. HOLY HELL!! I loved him from the minute he was introduced into the story!! A sexy French artist, what could be bad, non? Wellllll....besides stating that he was an artist and mentioning one or two of his paintings, there was no discussion of the art scene in Paris, what his artistic process was, just, nothing. I would have loved some discussion of his art. Something to fill out this part of the storyline. \n But I digress. Valentina meets the gorgeous and mysterious Sebastien and the two really connect. Sebastien has been emotionally closed off for many years, but finds himself falling in love with the beautiful, kind and sweet Valentina. I adore a good love triangle and I really felt tremendous sympathy for Valentina. She truly was torn between her husband and Sebastien. \n \"One day you're going to stop running away from me. And when that day finally comes, I'll be here waiting for you,\" he whispers softly, his words a caress. \"Now go ... before I change my mind and decide it doesn't please me to share you with others after all.\" \n There were some minor inconsistencies in the story but overall I loved the book until the last part. The plot just descended for me into soap-opera territory and was reminiscent of a favorite movie of mine - but it just didn't work for me here. Fans of Mia Asher will love this book, it just was not a favorite of mine. I will always read what Mia writes and eagerly look forward to her next books! \n Favorite quote: \n \"Il n'y a qu'un bonheur dans la vie, c'est d'aimer et d'etre aime.\" There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved. \n Our bodies are covered in sweat. The room smells like our dirty souls. And I fucking love it. \n There are others with far more classical features than hers. But none of them can hold a candle to her. She reminds me of the sea: untamed, unpredictable, but beautiful, so damn beautiful.
1 4.5 - 5 GORGEOUS STARS \n \"No rules. Live out loud. Find the sunshine.\" \n Simply stunning!! Emma Scott writes THE most lyrical and gorgeous fiction. Nik and Fiona have a permanent place in my heart! \n Called a contemporary romance \"with paranormal elements,\" I found this book to be incredibly moving and very, very touching. I would not exactly characterize the story as paranormal but more the tale of a deeply empathetic man who is simply searching for love and acceptance. And please don't be put off by this being the second book in a series. I have not read the first book and I absolutely fell in love with these characters and the plot. This book is a total standalone! \n Nik and Fiona are both lost and simply wishing for a better life. For Nik, he only wants to silence the cacophony of sounds and colors he sees and for Fiona, it is the hope of a new life in Costa Rica. And when they meet, it is pure magic. \n \"But it wasn't what was wrong with me, anymore. It was what was right. The girl exuded a calm that danced along my skin, and when I inhaled, it was like breathing in the scent of something delicious but far away. The thrumming life all around me grew quiet. For the first time, I felt close to peace, and I wanted more.\" \n What begins as a one-night stand with zero expectations for the future turns into a burning hot love and a deep, unbreakable connection. Emma Scott's love scenes are beautiful and SEXY and a joy to read! \n \"Nikolai Alexei,\" she whispered and cupped my cheeks to look at me in the dimness. \"Who are you?\" \n There are very important messages in this book as well as some very gritty and heartbreaking scenes. But ultimately the message is one of hope and acceptance and unconditional love. Once again, I won't soon forget the characters created by Emma Scott. A must-read! \n \"Love and hope,\" she said. \"That's life to me.\" \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
1 4.5 - 5 Stars!!! \n \"You know your reputation is just what everyone else thinks of you, your character is what you really are.\" \n Run, don't walk, to read this fantastic sports romance!! I am officially in love with Mariana Zapata's writing. This is my second book by this fantastic author and I am currently reading The Wall of Winnipeg and Me. I can't get enough!! \n I adore her strong heroines. Sal is a star soccer player in her Texas hometown. She's driven, focused and yes, a little socially awkward. She is absolutely shocked when she learns that her childhood idol, the superstar Reiner Kulti, is going to be one of her team's assistant coaches. \n I just sat there with the phone still to my face, lying in my bed two hundred miles away from where I'd grown up, soaking in the idea that Reiner Kulti--the Reiner Kulti-- was going to be my coach. I swallowed the nerves and anticipation down. No big deal. Right. \n Oh, and she also was sure that one day, she and Kulti would be married. She worshipped him until the cold reality of the sport brought her idol down a notch or ten and her dreams of a happily ever after were destroyed. Sal tries to hold it together and play it cool when Kulti arrives but she is starstruck just like everyone else. \n To my absolute horror, my inner thirteen-year-old, the one that had planned on marrying this guy and having soccer-playing super-babies with him, peeked in and reminded me she'd been around once. \n Kulti makes no friends when he joins the coaching staff. He is surly, silent and downright mean to everyone, players and fans alike. But Sal keeps reminded herself that he is human, just like everyone else, no better and no worse, and gradually, they reach a truce and an understanding. They actually become friends, with Kulti confiding in Sal that he doesn't trust anyone but he sees a real goodness and honesty in Sal. \n This book is a fantastic, enjoyable, slow-burn romance that had me literally staying up all night to finish. There is just something about Mariana Zapata's writing that is insanely addictive and completely REAL. My heart literally burst with emotion and I fell in love with Kulti. BUT do not expect instal-love here. In fact I wasn't even sure the main characters were ever going to have a civil conversation, let alone fall in love!! \n \"I used to have a huge crush on you.\" \n The German blinked at me and I had to fight the urge to twitch -- that would just make me look like I had something to hide. Which I did, but it wasn't like I wanted him to know that once upon a time there'd been posters of him all over my wall. Or that 'Sal loves Kulti' had been written in marker on every single notebook and folder I owned in middle school. \n \"Used to. Used. To. I was a little kid back then.\" \n Kulti seems hostile to everyone, including Sal. She slowly realizes that having worldwide fame and fortune might not be all that it's cracked up to be and that Kulti really can't lead a 'normal' life. Slowly Sal and Kulti become friends which poses a huge problem since he is one of the coaching staff. But the lines become blurred because Sal still has a huge crush on the very intimidating German. \n I'm not going to lie, not even a little bit. Besides a big butt, I had a thing for guys that spoke different languages. While Reiner Kulti was every bit as impressive of a male specimen as you could get physically, the way he spoke Spanish multiplied his attractiveness by about thirty percent. Okay, thirty percent minimum. But it wasn't like I could or would think about that too much. He was my coach. And I was his friend. Or something like that. \n This book is funny, sexy, romantic, exciting, action-packed...need I say more? Even if you are not a fan of sports romance, you will fall in love with Kulti. The author either really knows the sport of soccer (or football depending on your country) or she did some phenomenal research. The story was a pure delight from beginning to end. The last 20% of the book had me in tears!! I cannot recommend Kulti highly enough!! Mariana Zapata can do no wrong in my eyes. Kulti and Sal share a deep connection and a beautiful love story. This book is a must-read! \n \"This,\" he pointed between us. \"This is what matters. You are my gift, my second chance, and I will cherish you and your dream. I will protect both of you.
1 4.5 Stars \n LOVE LOVE LOVE this series! While not a standalone, 'American Prince' is just as magical and enticing as the first book. Without giving too much away, this book is Embry's story. Bad-boy Embry, who grows up to become the Vice-President of the United States. But he has always felt unworthy, of love, friendship and trust. \n \"I grew up around power, around the kind of people who exercised authority with effortless ease, but I myself had spent most of my life dodging any and all responsibility. Consequences were something to be charmed and flirted out of, other people were worth only how much fun they could give me. I had next to no practice taking care of other people...I could barely keep myself out of trouble.\" \n Poor Embry! He is selfless and misunderstood. I devoured this book and love how Sierra Simone reveals the real reasons why Embry acts the way he does. I loved reading his point of view of his relationship with Ash and with Greer. Yet another book by Ms. Simone that I could NOT put down! \n \"And if I ever thought Ash held all the power in their relationship, I see it clearly now. Embry holds my husband's heart in his hands and he doesn't even know it. He's too busy looking at the details of Ash's faces to see the expression, too busy being in love to see how loved he is.\" \n One of the things I love about this series is that there is no judgment from the author about the characters' choices or their lifestyle. They are just themselves. Always honest with other and always loving. Ms. Simone's great care in creating these characters is evident. This book ends on a cliffhanger but the final book will be released very soon so there's plenty of time to read this series before 'American King' comes out. This series is totally engaging and entertaining and I highly recommend it!! \n \"I'm done running from you,\" I said honestly. \"I tried and it didn't matter--you haunted me everywhere I went.\" \n \"And you haunted me,\" he murmured, rolling over to press his lips against mine once more. \"My little prince.\" \n And so the next act in our tragedy began.
1 \"How did it come to this? How did we get here? How will it end?\" \n What a perfect book to read during eclipse week 2017!! This taut and fast-paced thriller kept me on my toes until the very end. And what an ending! Kit and Laura are a young married couple who chase eclipses all over the world. It is an exciting, exotic lifestyle, hypnotic and mysterious all at once. \n \"Then the darkness comes. Without the countdown in the sky, it's pure and instant. All the street lights in the town below come on, so quickly it's like sparks igniting. Now, in the darkness, disappointment is replaced by the familiar thrill of totality. But this time it's different.\" \n The book begins in 2015 with Laura's point of view. She lives in London but she and her husband live anonymously. Why? The answer to that question unfolds slowly over the course of the book. We learn that Laura and Kit witnessed an violent assault during an eclipse festival years earlier and were witnesses for the prosecution during the trial of the attacker, Jamie. The trial was emotionally draining and physically exhausting for everyone and is described in minute detail. \n The brutal assault is also described in vivid detail so I was curious as to how any doubt could arise about Jamie's guilt or innocence. Just remember: there are many sides to each story. \n \"The moment you think about an act in terms of how, you are already halfway to doing it.\" \n We learn that Laura is now pregnant with twins but wants Kit to \"chase\" an upcoming eclipse while she stays behind in London, even though she is extremely paranoid about his travels. He has been an eclipse chaser since he was young and they both want to continue their adventures after their children are born. \n They live in fear that Beth, the young woman who had been raped years before, will find them again. She had befriended them after the trial of her attacker, but then became wildly unstable. Laura and Kit became convinced they had to disappear \"off the grid\" so that she would never find them again. \n This book was incredibly gripping and thought-provoking. It is told over the course of many years and features vivid characters and brilliantly-researched settings. The author forces the reader to confront their own morals and ask: What would you do in the same situation? \n \"Until that day I'd been thinking about the campaign in binary terms: either Jamie was in denial, or he was calling the world's bluff. But now a third possibility was inescapable, and one in which I was horrifically culpable. What if Jamie was innocent?\" \n This book was addictive and wildly surprising. The references to eclipses are fascinating and the format of the book is divided into the parts of an eclipse. With my husband and daughter away \"eclipse chasing\" while I was reading this book, the subject matter was even more compelling! With themes of loyalty, guilt and devotion, this book really did it for me. I highly recommend this creative and thrilling story!
1 Smart and sexy and delicious! I devoured this one. LOVE Ryder!!!! \n This is my second 1001 Dark nights novella and I really like this concept. Many of my favorite authors have written a novella in this format and so far, I have enjoyed the stories. Although 'Sweet Rivalry' is a standalone, Ryder first appeared in 'Sweet Cheeks' as Saylor's brother. This novella is a steamy, sweet and fast-paced romance that you can devour in one sitting. This short story is perfect for fans of Kristy Bromberg's steamy yet witty writing style. \n Ryder and his competitor Harper are bidding on a major construction project. They first met up during their college days and she has always been the best at everything. But Ryder is determined to win this time. Of course, they have some major chemistry, but business is business, right? \n \"Beard burn is a real thing. \n And oh my God it is everything I wanted it to be and then some. \" \n I always love the strong heroines in Kristy Bromberg's books. That is one of my favorites things about her writing. No wallflowers here! If you are looking for a fast, sexy, witty read with a guaranteed happy ending, then 'Sweet Rivalry' is just the ticket. My one complaint? That this story wasn't longer! Maybe we will get a full-length book about these two someday! \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
1 4.5 Stars!!! \n Romance lovers, rejoice and meet your next book boyfriend, Gabriel Dalton! \n \"You can't fix me you know...\" \n Mia Sheridan really knows how to create characters who have damaged souls and rough beginnings. People who are bullied, shunned and shut out from normal human interaction and love. And she's done it again with 'Most of All You.' Gabriel and Crystal's story is a rough journey and uncomfortable in parts, but so beautiful and uplifting that it is well worth the journey. \n \"He needed someone warm and caring. Someone who would nurture him and piece back together the broken parts. Someone who would look in his eyes and be his calming spirit. I was not that girl... \n This is in the end a totally swoon-y contemporary romance that has just the right amount of gritty reality to keep the story interesting. The main characters have both experienced deep heartache and childhood trauma that would break an ordinary person. Although this is most definitely a love story, the lovely way that Mia Sheridan treats Gabriel and Crystal's new and fragile friendship is the center and heart of the story. Books like this are why I read contemporary romance. Passion, honesty, damaged people simply searching for ordinary kindness - this book has it all. \n \"I was spellbound, caught once again in his gaze. No one has ever looked at me the way Gabriel was right then, not in all my life.\" \n While the more sinister elements of the plot are not detailed at length, there is enough revealed about both characters' pasts that explains why they act the way they do and the lives they currently lead. Gabriel is such a beautiful person that my heart ached for him throughout the book. \n \"Choice is such a loaded word, isn't it? Choices, though our own, were so weighted down with all the things that had come before, so stained with the messes of our past.\" \n This is a slow-burn romance but Gabriel and Crystal's story is SO worth the wait! Insta-love would NOT have worked here and I'm glad Mia Sheridan did not give into that often-used trope. Both main characters needed time to overcome their emotional barriers. And it felt oh so sweet when they finally come together. \n \"I wasn't a victim. I was a survivor...\" \n Mia Sheridan never fails to entice her readers. This is a heartfelt, sweet and very story and perfect for any romance reader. There is not too much darkness (I don't want to give too much away about the plot) but just enough to add drama and tension to the story. I guarantee you will fall in love with Gabriel Dalton! \n \"The longer she'd touched me, the more a yearning rose in my soul, so strong it took my breath.\" \n ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.
-1 I read this delightfully smutty book in a few hours and really enjoyed it. Yes the plot is a little far-fetched but the characters are engaging and the sexy times are CRAZY-hot. \n The title pretty much tells you what this book is all about. Chase is, well, a hot cop. \n \"There's always a woman waiting in the wings for a hot cop like him. A flock of them, even. In a place like Kansas, he's the closest thing we have to a rock star.\" \n Livia is a librarian who is approaching 30. She wants children but not a relationship. So Chase agrees to be a sperm donor with no strings attached. That's pretty much it. What I liked about this story was the well-developed characters and the funny banter. And the \"Kelley Trio\" - yes, Officer Kelley! \n Livia and Chase are insanely attracted to each other but both are extremely gun-shy about permanent relationships but they sure have loads of fun trying to make a baby! \n \"Megan, you never told me your brother was a hot.\" Oh my God. I didn't just say that. \n But I totally did. My face is heated with embarrassment. \"A cop! I meant a cop.\" \n This is a fun, sexy story with a very low angst factor. If you are looking for a guilty pleasure to enjoy for a few fun hours, then this is the book for you!
1 \"No matter what happens, even on your worst day, find something to be grateful about. It'll make you feel better.\" \n What a gorgeous book!! Emma Scott has a way of writing that is so beautiful, it is almost painful. But she also makes her characters seem real, very human, funny, flawed and just very authentic. \n Zelda finds herself all alone in New York City, having been robbed and left with nowhere to stay, She came to New York to try and see her graphic novel but is rejected and told to revise her project to give it \"more heart.\" She and Beckett meet by chance and I am not sure I have ever encountered two lonelier people than these two. \n \"One person alone against winter was rough. But two people, together... Together. A word I never used.\" \n Beckett and Zelda both have heartbreaking pasts. They both can't seem to move on but Beckett takes a chance on Zelda and lets her stay with him in his tiny apartment, temporarily and just as roommates. Slowly, they begin to realize that they care for each other but neither of them think they truly deserve happiness. This is a slow-build romance and the author takes care in creating a connection between the two main characters. I could feel them falling in love and was literally sobbing at the end. It is hard to explain when a book has that certain spark that makes it memorable but whatever it is, The Butterfly Project has it all. The writing is beautiful and there is plenty of steam but it is believable and very explosive when Beckett and Zelda finally get together. \n \"...I realized you could get used to anything--even being alone for years -- right until the moment you touched something better than what you had.\" \n A very sexy and emotional story, The Butterfly Project is one of my favorite books. It is a powerful tale of love and forgiveness. And the \"extras\" in this book are absolutely fantastic! All the stars to Emma Scott for this gorgeous story. \n \"You are my home, baby,\" he said. \"I never want to be anywhere else.\" \n ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.
1 4 1/2 Stars!! \n What a beautiful, gripping and intense story! I jumped into 'Preston's Honor' without knowing too much about the plot. There is so much to love about this book: second-chance love, burning passion, forgiveness and compassion. Lia, Preston and his brother Cole all grew up together in rural California. Lia's mother was a migrant farm worker and Lia always felt the pain of poverty and the sting of feeling not good enough. Not only did she have to endure teasing and bullying at school, her mother was also cold and unfeeling towards her. \n \"Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Nobody girl. Me.\" \n My heart!! Both brothers loved Lia, but through a series of events, it is Cole who begins to date Lia. Life happens, Preston and Cole leave for college and Lia is left behind in the small farming town. There are no opportunities for her to continue her education, and she is resigned to accept her lot in life. I absolutely love how the author sheds light on the conditions and the plight of our nation's migrant farm workers. Lia does her best but ends up working for minimum wage in order to support herself and her mother. \n The only bright spot in her life is Preston. She is overjoyed when he returns to town. Bound together by a tragedy, it is difficult to know whether their love will survive. \n \"Annalia. Christ. Seeing her again had been simultaneously torturous and joyful. I gripped the hair at my forehead, a sound of frustration coming up my throat. Hadn't that always been the case? Only this time . . . this time the shock of seeing her as a woman had nearly stopped my heart. I'd felt . . . breathless. Struck mute. Consumed.\" \n Will Preston and Lia be able to find happiness? Things really do seem hopeless for them and there is much heartache and misunderstandings between them. Lia was a lovely, honest, caring and gorgeous character (inside and out) and Preston was magnificent. My heart almost stopped several times while reading this passionate story! I was desperate for these two to find happiness. \n \"Thank you, Preston.\" For being my friend once, for giving me my first dance, for watching over me. It was all I had. It would have to be enough. \n Once again, Mia Sheridan does not disappoint. I highly recommend this beautiful tale of second chances, redemption and mercy. And the Prologue was a stunner!! Happy tears were flowing all around. \n \"Or actually, maybe this is exactly where we were meant to start. Tonight. This is our beginning, Annalia.\"
-1 This story had so much promise! And I love Whitney G.'s writing style; in fact, Turbulence was one of my favorite books this year. This was a cute, fast read BUT several typos later and a heroine who sends sexually explicit emails from her work account and I'm out. Moving on with high hopes for this author's next book. Call me an eternal optimist.
-1 3.5 Stars \n 'The Protector' is a perfectly enjoyable, sexy, fast-paced story. \n While it perhaps did not live up to JEM's superb story-telling potential, it was nonetheless am interesting and super-sexy story. I loved how the author presented another side to the heroine Camille: to the world, she is a rich, spoiled socialite. But she is actually smart and very ambitious and determined to build her own business from the ground up. She made lots of mistakes in the past, and some of those mistakes might be coming back to haunt her now. \n Jake is PURE Alpha, a former SAS sniper who suffers from PTSD. Camille does not want his protection, AT ALL, but her father hires Jake to make sure that Camille is safe. Jake is also haunted by his own personal demons, but sees his job with Camille as a chance at redemption. \n JEM remains one of my auto-buy authors. Her 'This Man' series is without question among my top favorite books of all time! And I absolutely fell in love with Miller in the 'One Night' series, another series that I HIGHLY recommend. Both Jesse and Miller are uber-Alphas beyond compare. \n So I thought 'The Protector' had lots of sizzling sex scenes and very fast-paced action along with a mystery story as well. While this is not my favorite JEM story, definitely give the one a try if you love this kind of contemporary romance! \n (ARC provided by the publisher in return for an honest review.)
-1 I adore Alexa Riley, I really do! Their short stories are my not-so-secret addiction. I think I've bought every one of them! 'Mechanic' is one of my favorites. So I was very excited to read their first full-length book. Unfortunately this story just didn't do it for me. The overly-possessive, controlling and bossy hero didn't even bother me at all; in fact he's a part of this writing duo's charm! Oz knew what he wanted and he went after her. What bothered me was that the heroine was a Yale grad but she sure didn't act like one. In addition, I had several issues with the plot which sadly interfered with my enjoyment of the story. And when did Nordstrom come to Manhattan? (Answer: it didn't. Nordstrom Rack doesn't count.) I'll continue to buy and read Alexa Riley's books, but this one was a miss for me.
-1 DNF. Gave up at around 20%. Way too many grammatical and editing issues for me to continue. I also couldn't get past the simplistic and degrading nickname that Vicious had for the heroine (he called her Help) That was offensive to me. Moving on.
-1 This started off with a bang, absolutely hilarious! This series should probably be read in order and I will defintiely read the first book to see what all the fuss is about. Tapping Her is a super-quick, very dirty and very funny bit of romantic comedy, with some laugh-out-loud moments and a great male POV. There is nothing emotional or angsty about this book and it's just a little something to pick up in between heavier reads. Not too much of a plot here, so don't expect War and Peace.
-1 For some reason, this story did not hold my interest. Stopped at about 35% but will pick this one up again later. I usually devour KA books but I'm moving on.", "date_added": "Mon May 23 17:45:54 -0700 2016
-1 2.5 - 3 Stars \n As much I loved CRAZY GOOD, the debut book from this author, I am not quite sure what to make of this latest book. CRAZY GOOD was a sexy, refreshing, very readable story with an unforgettable Alpha and it was exciting to read a new author. Unfortunately, TIME AND SPACE did not work for me at all. There is a dramatic, totally unbelievable plot twist literally dropped into the story with zero explanation or set-up. Added to the large number of editing and grammar issues, I'm afraid this just wasn't for me. Perhaps some editing next time around will help. I will definitely give this author a try again but this whole book was just a giant puzzle to me.
-1 I love an erotic suspense and dark romance as much as the next person but this book just didn't quite do it for me. I literally felt dropped right into the middle of a story that had already begun, which was very disorienting. While many readers are raving about this book, for me there was no connection between the main characters and many of their actions felt mechanical, and the story, formulaic. I still would love to read the other books by this author, because their story lines sound very intriguing. Giving credit here for a very strong, kick-ass heroine, and a surprising ending. \n (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)
-1 Well, hmmmm. Although lots of readers raved about this story, it just didn't work for me on many levels. I can live with instalove and instalust, but the main characters got together way too early in the story for me to feel any connection between them whatsoever. The storyline is clever and could have made a good book, but there was just too much thrown in to create any real depth to the characters or to the situations. There is a major plot twist at the end that is just completely and utterly unbelievable. I give the author credit for some interesting ideas, but this book is in need of a good editor. Also there is a wrong word that is used during a crucial scene that hopefully was fixed in the final version. I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume that is was because if not, it completely changed the tone of the scene. ( Usually I purchase the finished book but I didn't in this case.) So take a look at all the positive reviews, and give is one a try if you think it's for you!
-1 3.5 Stars!! \n Lauren Dane writes an super-sexy story, with a couple who have some piercings in very, um, key places! \n Ms. Dane has written some of my favorite and sexiest contemporary romance novels (The Brown Family series is a favorite and highly recommended - they are totally addictive.) Opening Up is the first in her new Ink and Chrome series. The plot is light, steamy, funny, fast-paced and pretty much angst-free. \n I couldn't wait to dive into this book and I read it one sitting. PJ is a young, strong-willed woman who breaks free from her overbearing family and ventures out on her own in the world off body shop painting. She meets Asa, who is older, totally domineering and sex-on-a-stick. He accepts her for who she is and their sex is, to put it mildly, off the charts. Think multiple piercings, sexy tattoos and passionate car sex! \n \"You're defiling her in your head right now, aren't you?\" \n Hell yes. \n There is nothing too dramatic or earth shattering in this book. I loved the chemistry between PJ and Asa and you will need a fan for their scenes together. OPENING UP is the perfect summertime read to take to the pool or beach, and the secondary characters are just as enjoyable! (I cannot wait for Duke, Asa's friend, to get his story in FALLING UNDER, coming out in August. Hello! Can you say huge, tattooed and sexy?) All in all, OPENING UP is a passionate, funny, dirty and light summer read with a HEA. Enjoy! \n \"Wait. I want to see you put the condom on over the piercing. I should know this. For future reference.\" \n I received an ARC of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
-1 Please please please don't let there be typos in the finished book like there are in the Goodreads summary!!
-1 3.5 Stars! \n Parallel universes? Yes, please! I have always been intrigued with stories about the path not taken. The blurb of MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE intrigued me and made me think of one of my favorite movies, Sliding Doors. While this book was not all that I had hoped for, it is nonetheless a well-written, thought-provoking story about the consequences of our actions, fate and destiny. \n Taylor Jenkins Reid brings a unique and fresh voice to the idea that our soul mates are out there, and that our choices lead us to our own realities. Both parallel stories in this book were engaging, REAL, and very original. The characters are all very relatable and some of their stories more poignant than others. \n \"I know there may be universes out there where I made different choices and they led me somewhere else, led me to someone else. And my heart breaks for every single version of me that didn't end up with you.\" \n Our heroine Hannah takes two widely divergent paths, as does her best friend Gabby. I did feel an overriding sense of sadness while reading this book, which, happily, was replaced by joy by the end. MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE is a very thoughtful and interesting book, which will make you think about your choices in life, and whether fate ever really plays a part in our lives. Is everything all mapped out, occurring anyway no matter what our choices might be? There's lots to chew on here and I will say that I was totally surprised by the ending of this book. \n I would have like a little more detail about some of the more meaningful events in this book. However, much of this story seems aimed at twenty-somethings who will very much enjoy Hannah's journey. I did feel that some important details were missing, but overall, both the writing and the story were very intriguing and fresh. \n I read this in one sitting and I will definitely grab the author's other books now. Love, loss, family, friendship, loyalty -- they are all covered here and I think this is the perfect summertime read.", "date_added": "Tue Apr 14 20:44:55 -0700 2015
-1 3 - 3.5 Stars \n Emma Chase is one of my favorite authors but this story just did not click with me. I am in the minority on this one so you should defintely give this one a try! Lots of readers LOVE Stanton. A few inconsistencies in the timeline interfered with my enjoyment of the book and I found some of characters to be Southern stereotypes. I also didn't really feel the emotional connection between Stanton and Sofia. I absolutely adore this talented author and will always read her books! Ms. Chase has a very funny way with her male characters which I love. Definitely looking forward to the next books in this series. \n (ARC provided by the publisher with thanks.)
-1 Many readers loved this book but it just wasn't for me. I am a fan of dark romance, dark erotica, romantic thrillers, the whole nine yards so the darker elements were fine for me but I just didn't connect with the main characters. I definitely suggest giving this book a try because the story has a lot of promise but there were just too many character and plot inconsistencies for me to become invested in the story. I will read the author's other books because they sound very interesting and readers whose opinion I trust have really loved her writing.
-1 Review to follow.
-1 Good debut from this author. Review to come!
-1 This novella gets 5 stars for the absolutely smoking hot sex scenes and great dialogue, and 1 star for the often laughable supporting storyline. There are so many completely made-up details in this story that would never, ever happen in real life (and would land the main characters in a real courtroom) that it made it very difficult for me to enjoy the sexy and engaging banter between the two main characters. I did love the alternating POV's but the glaring inaccuracies in this story aggravated the hell out of me. This is pure, escapist fantasy, that can be read in just one sitting. The author does a great job at establishing an emotional connection between the characters and I definitely will read the next installment.
-1 For Cathy's review and an excerpt from the book, go to The Book Bellas
-1 Kristen Ashley on steroids. Good story but lots of typos and errors.
-1 Writing is all over the place. My first Megan Hart book. No clear point of view.
